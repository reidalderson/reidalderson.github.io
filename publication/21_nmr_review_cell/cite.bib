abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Inc. Biomolecules are in constant motion. To understand how they function, and why malfunctions can cause disease, it is necessary to describe their three-dimensional structures in terms of dynamic conformational ensembles. Here, we demonstrate how nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides an essential, dynamic view of structural biology that captures biomolecular motions at atomic resolution. We focus on examples that emphasize the diversity of biomolecules and biochemical applications that are amenable to NMR, such as elucidating functional dynamics in large molecular machines, characterizing transient conformations implicated in the onset of disease, and obtaining atomic-level descriptions of intrinsically disordered regions that make weak interactions involved in liquid-liquid phase separation. Finally, we discuss the pivotal role that NMR has played in driving forward our understanding of the biomolecular dynamics-function paradigm.},
