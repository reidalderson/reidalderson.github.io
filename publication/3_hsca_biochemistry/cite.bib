 abstract = {© 2014 American Chemical Society.  Proteins from the isc operon of Escherichia coli constitute the machinery used to synthesize iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters for delivery to recipient apoproteins. Efficient and rapid [2Fe-2S] cluster transfer from the holo-scaffold protein IscU depends on ATP hydrolysis in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of HscA, a specialized Hsp70-type molecular chaperone with low intrinsic ATPase activity (0.02 min -1 at 25 °C, henceforth reported in units of min -1 ). HscB, an Hsp40-type cochaperone, binds to HscA and stimulates ATP hydrolysis to promote cluster transfer, yet while the interactions between HscA and HscB have been investigated, the role of HscA's interdomain linker in modulating ATPase activity has not been explored. To address this issue, we created three variants of the 40 kDa NBD of HscA: NBD alone (HscA 386 ), NBD with a partial linker (HscA 389 ), and NBD with the full linker (HscA 395 ). We found that the rate of ATP hydrolysis of HscA 395 (0.45 min -1 ) is nearly 15-fold higher than that of HscA 386 (0.035 min -1 ), although their apparent affinities for ATP are equivalent. HscA 395 , which contains the full covalently linked linker peptide, exhibited intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission and basal thermostability that were higher than those of HscA 386 . Furthermore, HscA 395 displayed narrower 1 H N line widths in its two-dimensional 1 H- 15 N TROSY-HSQC spectrum in comparison to HscA 386 , indicating that the peptide in the cis configuration binds to and stabilizes the structure of the NBD. The addition to HscA 386 of a synthetic peptide with a sequence identical to that of the interdomain linker (L 387 LLDVIPLS 395 ) stimulated its ATPase activity and induced widespread NMR chemical shift perturbations indicative of a binding interaction in the trans configuration.},
