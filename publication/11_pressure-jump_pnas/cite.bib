For proteins with a substantial volume difference between the folded and unfolded states, their thermodynamic equilibrium can be altered by varying the hydrostatic pressure. Using a pressure-sensitized mutant of ubiquitin, we demonstrate that rapidly switching the pressure within an NMR sample cell enables study of the unfolded protein under native conditions and, vice versa, study of the native protein under denaturing conditions. This approach makes it possible to record 2D and 3D NMR spectra of the unfolded protein at atmospheric pressure, providing residue-specific information on the folding process. 15N and 13C chemical shifts measured immediately after dropping the pressure from 2.5 kbar (favoring unfolding) to 1 bar (native) are close to the random-coil chemical shifts observed for a large, disordered peptide fragment of the protein. However, 15N relaxation data show evidence for rapid exchange, on a ∼100-$μ$s timescale, between the unfolded state and unstable, structured states that can be considered as failed folding events. The NMR data also provide direct evidence for parallel folding pathways, with approximately one-half of the protein molecules efficiently folding through an on-pathway kinetic intermediate, whereas the other half fold in a single step. At protein concentrations above ∼300 $μ$M, oligomeric off-pathway intermediates compete with folding of the native state.},
