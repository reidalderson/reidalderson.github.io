 abstract = {© 2019, The Author(s). Isotopically labeled methyl groups provide NMR probes in large, otherwise deuterated proteins. However, the resonance assignment constitutes a bottleneck for broader applicability of methyl-based NMR. Here, we present the automated MethylFLYA method for the assignment of methyl groups that is based on methyl-methyl nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) peak lists. MethylFLYA is applied to five proteins (28–358 kDa) comprising a total of 708 isotope-labeled methyl groups, of which 612 contribute NOESY cross peaks. MethylFLYA confidently assigns 488 methyl groups, i.e. 80% of those with NOESY data. Of these, 459 agree with the reference, 6 were different, and 23 were without reference assignment. MethylFLYA assigns significantly more methyl groups than alternative algorithms, has an average error rate of 1%, modest runtimes of 0.4–1.2 h, and can handle arbitrary isotope labeling patterns and data from other types of NMR spectra.},
