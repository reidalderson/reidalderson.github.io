 abstract = {© This article not subject to U.S. Copyright. Published 2018 by the American Chemical Society.  Pressure-jump hardware permits direct observation of protein NMR spectra during a cyclically repeated protein folding process. For a two-state folding protein, the change in resonance frequency will occur nearly instantaneously when the protein clears the transition state barrier, resulting in a monoexponential change of the ensemble-averaged chemical shift. However, protein folding pathways can be more complex and contain metastable intermediates. With a pseudo-3D NMR experiment that utilizes stroboscopic observation, we measure the ensemble-averaged chemical shifts, including those of exchange-broadened intermediates, during the folding process. Such measurements for a pressure-sensitized mutant of ubiquitin show an on-pathway kinetic intermediate whose 15 N chemical shifts differ most from the natively folded protein for strands $β$5, its preceding turn, and the two strands that pair with $β$5 in the native structure.},
