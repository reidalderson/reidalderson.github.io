abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 Pulsed-field gradient NMR spectroscopy is widely used to measure the translational diffusion and hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of biomolecules in solution. For unfolded proteins, the Rh provides a sensitive reporter on the ensemble-averaged conformation and the extent of polypeptide chain expansion as a function of added denaturant. Hydrostatic pressure is a convenient and reversible alternative to chemical denaturants for the study of protein folding, and enables NMR measurements to be performed on a single sample. While the impact of pressure on the viscosity of water is well known, and our water diffusivity measurements agree closely with theoretical expectations, we find that elevated pressures increase the Rh of dioxane and other small molecules by amounts that correlate with their hydrophobicity, with parallel increases in rotational friction indicated by 13C longitudinal relaxation times. These data point to a tighter coupling with water for hydrophobic surfaces at elevated pressures. Translational diffusion measurement of the unfolded state of a pressure-sensitized ubiquitin mutant (VA2-ubiquitin) as a function of hydrostatic pressure or urea concentration shows that Rh values of both the folded and the unfolded states remain nearly invariant. At ca 23 {\AA}, the Rh of the fully pressure-denatured state is essentially indistinguishable from the urea-denatured state, and close to the value expected for an idealized random coil of 76 residues. The intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) $\alpha$-synuclein shows slight compaction at pressures above 2 kbar. Diffusion of unfolded ubiquitin and $\alpha$-synuclein is significantly impacted by sample concentration, indicating that quantitative measurements need to be carried out under dilute conditions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd Small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) are molecular chaperones that respond to cellular stresses to combat protein aggregation. HSP27 is a critical human sHSP that forms large, dynamic oligomers whose quaternary structures and chaperone activities depend on environmental factors. Upon exposure to cellular stresses, such as heat shock or acidosis, HSP27 oligomers can dissociate into dimers and monomers, which leads to significantly enhanced chaperone activity. The structured core of the protein, the $\alpha$-crystallin domain (ACD), forms dimers and can prevent the aggregation of substrate proteins to a similar degree as the full-length protein. When the ACD dimer dissociates into monomers, it partially unfolds and exhibits enhanced activity. Here, we used solution-state NMR spectroscopy to characterize the structure and dynamics of the HSP27 ACD monomer. Web show that the monomer is stabilized at low pH and that its backbone chemical shifts, 15N relaxation rates, and 1H–15N residual dipolar couplings suggest structural changes and rapid motions in the region responsible for dimerization. By analyzing the solvent accessible and buried surface areas of sHSP structures in the context of a database of dimers that are known to dissociate into disordered monomers, we predict that ACD dimers from sHSPs across all kingdoms of life may partially unfold upon dissociation. We propose a general model in which conditional disorder—the partial unfolding of ACDs upon monomerization—is a common mechanism for sHSP activity.},

In some cases, changes to the dynamical equilibria between conformations can lead to pathological protein aggregation and to the disruption of cellular homeostasis. The detection and characterization of lowly populated conformers is therefore crucial for understanding the basis of protein misfolding. NMR spectroscopy is exquisitely sensitive to the conformational dynamics of biomolecules and can be used to study sparsely populated states at the atomic level. Here, we review recent progress toward understanding the roles of sparsely populated, otherwise ‘invisible' states present in protein folding and misfolding, where NMR has provided unique insight into folding intermediates, transiently misfolded states, and soluble oligomers that precede amyloid fibril formation.},

Here, we describe redox-induced changes to the structure, dynamics, and function of HSP27 and its conserved $\alpha$-crystallin domain (ACD). While HSP27 assembles into oligomers, we show that the monomers formed upon reduction are highly active chaperones in vitro, but are susceptible to self-aggregation. By using relaxation dispersion and high-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we observe that the pair of $\beta$-strands that mediate dimerisation partially unfold in the monomer. We note that numerous HSP27 mutations associated with inherited neuropathies cluster to this dynamic region. High levels of sequence conservation in ACDs from mammalian sHSPs suggest that the exposed, disordered interface present in free monomers or oligomeric subunits may be a general, functional feature of sHSPs.},

However, the resonance assignment constitutes a bottleneck for broader applicability of methyl-based NMR. Here, we present the automated MethylFLYA method for the assignment of methyl groups that is based on methyl-methyl nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) peak lists. MethylFLYA is applied to five proteins (28–358 kDa) comprising a total of 708 isotope-labeled methyl groups, of which 612 contribute NOESY cross peaks. MethylFLYA confidently assigns 488 methyl groups, i.e. 80{\%} of those with NOESY data. Of these, 459 agree with the reference, 6 were different, and 23 were without reference assignment. MethylFLYA assigns significantly more methyl groups than alternative algorithms, has an average error rate of 1{\%}, modest runtimes of 0.4–1.2 h, and can handle arbitrary isotope labeling patterns and data from other types of NMR spectra.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. In general, small proteins rapidly fold on the timescale of milliseconds or less. For proteins with a substantial volume difference between the folded and unfolded states, their thermodynamic equilibrium can be altered by varying the hydrostatic pressure. Using a pressure-sensitized mutant of ubiquitin, we demonstrate that rapidly switching the pressure within an NMR sample cell enables study of the unfolded protein under native conditions and, vice versa, study of the native protein under denaturing conditions. This approach makes it possible to record 2D and 3D NMR spectra of the unfolded protein at atmospheric pressure, providing residue-specific information on the folding process. 15N and 13C chemical shifts measured immediately after dropping the pressure from 2.5 kbar (favoring unfolding) to 1 bar (native) are close to the random-coil chemical shifts observed for a large, disordered peptide fragment of the protein. However, 15N relaxation data show evidence for rapid exchange, on a ∼100-$\mu$s timescale, between the unfolded state and unstable, structured states that can be considered as failed folding events. The NMR data also provide direct evidence for parallel folding pathways, with approximately one-half of the protein molecules efficiently folding through an on-pathway kinetic intermediate, whereas the other half fold in a single step. At protein concentrations above ∼300 $\mu$M, oligomeric off-pathway intermediates compete with folding of the native state.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH  {\&}  Co. KGaA, Weinheim In unfolded proteins, peptide bonds involving Pro residues exist in equilibrium between the minor cis and major trans conformations. Folded proteins predominantly contain trans-Pro bonds, and slow cis–trans Pro isomerization in the unfolded state is often found to be a rate-limiting step in protein folding. Moreover, kinases and phosphatases that act upon Ser/Thr−Pro motifs exhibit preferential recognition of either the cis- or trans-Pro conformer. Here, NMR spectra obtained at both atmospheric and high pressures indicate that the population of cis-Pro falls well below previous estimates, an effect attributed to the use of short peptides with charged termini in most prior model studies. For the intrinsically disordered protein $\alpha$-synuclein, cis-Pro populations at all of its five X−Pro bonds are less than 5 {\%}, with only modest ionic strength dependence and no detectable effect of the previously demonstrated interaction between the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein. Comparison to small peptides with the same amino-acid sequence indicates that peptides, particularly those with unblocked, oppositely charged amino and carboxyl end groups, strongly overestimate the amount of cis-Pro.},

Pressure-jump hardware permits direct observation of protein NMR spectra during a cyclically repeated protein folding process. For a two-state folding protein, the change in resonance frequency will occur nearly instantaneously when the protein clears the transition state barrier, resulting in a monoexponential change of the ensemble-averaged chemical shift. However, protein folding pathways can be more complex and contain metastable intermediates. With a pseudo-3D NMR experiment that utilizes stroboscopic observation, we measure the ensemble-averaged chemical shifts, including those of exchange-broadened intermediates, during the folding process. Such measurements for a pressure-sensitized mutant of ubiquitin show an on-pathway kinetic intermediate whose 15 N chemical shifts differ most from the natively folded protein for strands $\beta$5, its preceding turn, and the two strands that pair with $\beta$5 in the native structure.},

Methyl groups are powerful probes for the analysis of structure, dynamics and function of supramolecular assemblies, using both solution- and solid-state NMR. Widespread application of the methodology has been limited due to the challenges associated with assigning spectral resonances to specific locations within a biomolecule. Here, we present Methyl Assignment by Graph Matching (MAGMA), for the automatic assignment of methyl resonances. A graph matching protocol examines all possibilities for each resonance in order to determine an exact assignment that includes a complete description of any ambiguity. MAGMA gives 100{\%} accuracy in confident assignments when tested against both synthetic data, and 9 cross-validated examples using both solution- and solid-state NMR data. We show that this remarkable accuracy enables a user to distinguish between alternative protein structures. In a drug discovery application on HSP90, we show the method can rapidly and efficiently distinguish between possible ligand binding modes. By providing an exact and robust solution to methyl resonance assignment, MAGMA can facilitate significantly accelerated studies of supramolecular machines using methyl-based NMR spectroscopy.},

A method is introduced that permits direct observation of the rates at which backbone amide hydrogens become protected from solvent exchange after rapidly dropping the hydrostatic pressure inside the NMR sample cell from denaturing (2.5 kbar) to native (1 bar) conditions. The method is demonstrated for a pressure-sensitized ubiquitin variant that contains two Val to Ala mutations. Increased protection against hydrogen exchange with solvent is monitored as a function of time during the folding process. Results for 53 backbone amides show narrow clustering with protection occurring with a time constant of ca. 85 ms, but slower protection is observed around a reverse turn near the C-terminus of the protein. Remarkably, the native NMR spectrum returns with this slower time constant of ca. 150 ms, indicating that the almost fully folded protein retains molten globule characteristics with severe NMR line broadening until the final hydrogen bonds are formed. Prior to crossing the transition state barrier, hydrogen exchange protection factors are close to unity, but with slightly elevated values in the $\beta$1-$\beta$2 hairpin, previously shown to be already lowly populated in the urea-denatured state.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s). In mammals, small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) typically assemble into interconverting, polydisperse oligomers. The dynamic exchange of sHSP oligomers is regulated, at least in part, by molecular interactions between the $\alpha$-crystallin domain and the C-terminal region (CTR). Here we report solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy investigations of the conformation and dynamics of the disordered and flexible CTR of human HSP27, a systemically expressed sHSP. We observed multiple NMR signals for residues in the vicinity of proline 194, and we determined that, while all observed forms are highly disordered, the extra resonances arise from cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerization about the G193-P194 peptide bond. The cis-P194 state is populated to near 15{\%} at physiological temperatures, and, although both cis- and trans-P194 forms of the CTR are flexible and dynamic, both states show a residual but differing tendency to adopt $\beta$-strand conformations. In NMR spectra of an isolated CTR peptide, we observed similar evidence for isomerization involving proline 182, found within the IPI/V motif. Collectively, these data indicate a potential role for cis-trans proline isomerization in regulating the oligomerization of sHSPs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014. Proteins containing iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters arose early in evolution and are essential to life. Organisms have evolved machinery consisting of specialized proteins that operate together to assemble Fe-S clusters efficiently so as to minimize cellular exposure to their toxic constituents: iron and sulfide ions. To date, the best studied system is the iron-sulfur cluster (isc) operon of Escherichia coli, and the eight ISC proteins it encodes. Our investigations over the past five years have identified two functional conformational states for the scaffold protein (IscU) and have shown that the other ISC proteins that interact with IscU prefer to bind one conformational state or the other. From analyses of the NMR spectroscopy-derived network of interactions of ISC proteins, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, chemical crosslinking experiments, and functional assays, we have constructed working models for Fe-S cluster assembly and delivery. Future work is needed to validate and refine what has been learned about the E. coli system and to extend these findings to the homologous Fe-S cluster biosynthetic machinery of yeast and human mitochondria.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.  Proteins from the isc operon of Escherichia coli constitute the machinery used to synthesize iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters for delivery to recipient apoproteins. Efficient and rapid [2Fe-2S] cluster transfer from the holo-scaffold protein IscU depends on ATP hydrolysis in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of HscA, a specialized Hsp70-type molecular chaperone with low intrinsic ATPase activity (0.02 min -1 at 25 °C, henceforth reported in units of min -1 ). HscB, an Hsp40-type cochaperone, binds to HscA and stimulates ATP hydrolysis to promote cluster transfer, yet while the interactions between HscA and HscB have been investigated, the role of HscA's interdomain linker in modulating ATPase activity has not been explored. To address this issue, we created three variants of the 40 kDa NBD of HscA: NBD alone (HscA 386 ), NBD with a partial linker (HscA 389 ), and NBD with the full linker (HscA 395 ). We found that the rate of ATP hydrolysis of HscA 395 (0.45 min -1 ) is nearly 15-fold higher than that of HscA 386 (0.035 min -1 ), although their apparent affinities for ATP are equivalent. HscA 395 , which contains the full covalently linked linker peptide, exhibited intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission and basal thermostability that were higher than those of HscA 386 . Furthermore, HscA 395 displayed narrower 1 H N line widths in its two-dimensional 1 H- 15 N TROSY-HSQC spectrum in comparison to HscA 386 , indicating that the peptide in the cis configuration binds to and stabilizes the structure of the NBD. The addition to HscA 386 of a synthetic peptide with a sequence identical to that of the interdomain linker (L 387 LLDVIPLS 395 ) stimulated its ATPase activity and induced widespread NMR chemical shift perturbations indicative of a binding interaction in the trans configuration.},

Here, we used solution NMR spectroscopy to investigate the ATP-/ADP-dependent interactions between Escherichia coli HscA and HscB, the specialized Hsp70/Hsp40 molecular chaperones that mediate iron-sulfur cluster transfer. We observed that NMR signals assigned to amino acid residues in the J-domain and its HPD motif of HscB broadened severely upon the addition of ATP-bound HscA, but these signals were not similarly broadened by ADP-bound HscA or the isolated nucleotide binding domain of HscA complexed with either ATP or ADP. An HscB variant with an altered HPD motif, HscB(H32A,P33A,D34A), failed to manifest WT-like NMR signal perturbations and also abolished WT-like stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by HscA. In addition, residues 153-171 in the C-terminal region of HscB exhibited NMR signal perturbations upon interaction with HscA, alone or complexed with ADP or ATP. These results demonstrate that the HPD motif in the J-domain of HscB directly interacts with ATP-bound HscA and suggest that a second, less nucleotide-dependent binding site for HscA resides in the C-terminal region of HscB. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},
